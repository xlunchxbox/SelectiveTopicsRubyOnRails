Assign3 Due 11:59PM August 2nd

In Assignment 2 you wrote a console application. You will create a 
Rails application for the same here (you are not required to copy or
reuse code from that assignment. Feel free to create fresh code here).

Your code should have the following:

Good unit and functional tests.
High coverage
User should be able to view the workers when they visit your application url
(without providing any controller name - so simply visiting 
http://localhost:3000 should show the workers list).

On this page, list workers and provide a link for work orders.

Clicking on the work orders should present a search page where work orders 
matching a search criteria (status) can be displayed.

When search is complete, list work order details along with link to a worker that
the work order is assigned to.

When a worker is selected, it should list details of the worker and a list
of all work orders assigned to that worker.

Provide a way to assign a work order to a worker.

Make the application intuitive and easy to use to managing (CRUD operations on) worker and work orders.
